            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p>Hello, my name is Andrew. I am taking Interactive Media Design so I can add to my studio photography skill set.
                I am also hoping to start a YouTube channel for my miniature painting hobby, mainly <abbr title="Warhammer 40,000">WH40K</abbr> models.
            </p>
            <p>
                The channel name is Nova Cult. I based the idea for the channel name on the chaos cultist miniatures in my Death Guard Army.
            </p>
