        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Andrew and I am from Ottawa, Canada. I am taking <em>Interactive Media Design</em> so I can add more utility to my photography skillset.</p> 
        <p>I am currently working in a photo studio where I photograph families, newborns, couples and business professionals.</p>
        <p>I hope to be able to open myself up to more opportunities in the world of media design and to find a future career that allows me to pursue my creative interests. 
            <p>I greatly enjoy new adventures and challenges. I want to experience a joyful life full of purpose and meaning. I like <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> </p>
