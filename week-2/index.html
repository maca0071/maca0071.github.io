    <h1>22<sup>nd</sup>September, 2020</h1>
        <p>My name is Andrew and I am from Ottawa, Canada. I am taking <em>Interactive Media Design</em> so I can add more utility to my Photography skillset. I am currently working in a photo studio where I photograph families, newborns, couples and business professionals. 
            <p>I hope to be able to open myself up to more opportunities in the world of media design and to find a future career that allows me to pursue my creative interests. I greatly enjoy new adventures and challenges. I want to experience a joyful life full of purpose and meaning. </p>
<q>Happiness was never important. The problem is that we don't know what we really want. What makes us happy is not to get what we want. But to dream about it.</q>
